The practical exam consists of two steps:

## Oral exam
One question for each lecture (available [here](/courses/ds4iot/lectures/)).

## Discussion of the project
- Selection of a topic.
- Study of the state-of-art solutions (Edge/Fog, Cloud, IoT) related to the selected topic.
- Modeling and Simulation using iFogSim:
	- Compare different topologies and parameter settings.
	- Describe the obtained results in terms of:
		- Latency
		- Network usage
		- Energy consumption
		- Other metrics
- Implement some functionalities of the modeled system using frameworks provided by Eclipse IoT, focusing on different layers.
- Write a report to be delivered before the exam.
- Prepare a presentation to be used during the discussion of the project.

The **deadline** for delivering the project (*report + code*) is **7 days before the exam**.

More info about the project and some ideas about the topic are available [here](../../pdf/Projects.pdf).
