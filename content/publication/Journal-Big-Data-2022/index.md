abstract: "In the age of the Internet of Things and social media platforms, huge amounts of
digital data are generated by and collected from many sources, including sensors,
mobile devices, wearable trackers and security cameras. This data, commonly
referred to as Big Data, is challenging current storage, processing, and analysis
capabilities. New models, languages, systems and algorithms continue to be
developed to effectively collect, store, analyze and learn from Big Data. Most of
the recent surveys provide a global analysis of the tools that are used in the main
phases of Big Data management (generation, acquisition, storage, querying and
visualization of data). Differently, this work analyzes and reviews parallel and
distributed paradigms, languages and systems used today to analyze and learn
from Big Data on scalable computers. In particular, we provide an in-depth
analysis of the properties of the main parallel programming paradigms
(MapReduce, workflow, BSP, message passing, and SQL-like) and, through
programming examples, we describe the most used systems for Big Data analysis
(e.g., Hadoop, Spark, and Storm). Furthermore, we discuss and compare the
different systems by highlighting the main features of each of them, their
diffusion (community of developers and users) and the main advantages and
disadvantages of using them to implement Big Data analysis applications. The
final goal of this work is to help designers and developers in identifying and
selecting the best/appropriate programming solution based on their skills,
hardware availability, application domains and purposes, and also considering the 
support provided by the developer community."
