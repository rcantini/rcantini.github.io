abstract: "The edge-to-cloud compute continuum has become increasingly popular
in recent years for effectively collecting and analyzing data generated by Internet of
Things (IoT) devices at the network edge, ensuring low latency, high scalability, and
privacy preservation. This continuum of computing resources, features, and services,
which spans from the edge to the cloud, can be effectively leveraged in various application
domains like smart cities, industrial IoT, and smart healthcare. However, many
unexplored scenarios still exist where this technology can be successfully applied.
This chapter investigates how the compute continuum can support speaker tracking
in smart spaces, such as smart homes, offices, and public venues, especially focusing
on multimodal systems that leverage both audio and visual data. The effectiveness
of the edge-to-cloud continuum in supporting such systems was assessed through
a simulation-based experimental evaluation performed with the iFogSim toolkit.
Our findings reveal that edge-cloud integration improves application performance in
terms of network usage and latency, compared to a centralized solution that solely
relies on cloud computing."
