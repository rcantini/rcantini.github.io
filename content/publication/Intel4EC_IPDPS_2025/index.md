abstract: "In the digital landscape, social media has emerged as a prevalent channel for
global communication, connecting like-minded individuals worldwide. However,
while facilitating information exchange, it is also susceptible to the dissemination
of false information, posing a constant challenge to the reliability of
online content. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel methodology
called TM-FID (*Topic-oriented Multimodal False Information Detection*),
which combines false information detection and neural topic modeling within a
semi-supervised multimodal approach. By jointly leveraging textual and visual
information contained in online news, our approach provides insights into how
false information influences specific discussion topics, thus enabling a comprehensive
and fine-grained understanding of its spread and impact on social media
conversation. Experimental evaluation carried out on a set of multimodal gossiprelated
news demonstrates the quality of the identified topics, assessed through
a novel centroid-based metric, as well as the efficacy of the cross-attention
mechanism used within TM-FID to accurately identify false information in multimodal
news. Overall, the proposed methodology can enable effective strategies
to counter the spread of false information, thereby fostering trust and confidence
in the information shared on social media platforms."
