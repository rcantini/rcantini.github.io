abstract: "In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), conventional cloud-based solutions
struggle to handle the huge amount, high velocity, and heterogeneity of data
generated at the network edge. In this context, the edge-to-cloud compute continuum
has emerged as an effective solution to reduce bandwidth consumption and latency
in large-scale applications, through seamless integration of edge computing with
cloud services and features. In this chapter, we show how the compute continuum
can be effectively leveraged in the context of smart agriculture, with the aim of
supporting greenhouse monitoring and management. We also analyze how LSTM
neural networks can be integrated into the system to cope with the presence of missing
and anomalous sensor data. A thorough experimental evaluation is performed to
assess the LSTM performance, also showing how the application deployment at the
compute continuum can ensure higher scalability in terms of bandwidth and latency,
compared to a conventional cloud-based solution. Our findings show how the joint
use of the compute continuum and deep learning can enable the development of a
green-aware solution that fosters sustainable and efficient agricultural practices."
