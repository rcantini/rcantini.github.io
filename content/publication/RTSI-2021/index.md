abstract: "Nowadays, the number of people who prefer to
make online purchases on e-commerce platforms is constantly
increasing. Online shopping turns out to be fast and cheap but
it also involves some risks. In fact, it sometimes happens that
a product, once received, is smaller or bigger than expected,
or does not comply with what is described on the purchase
site. Typically this happens because the information provided
by retailers is not detailed and, moreover, the images usually
show the product on a white background without any reference
nearby to understand its true dimensions. To cope with this
problem, we developed CompareDimensions, a software tool that
helps customers during their online purchases, by allowing them
to understand the correct dimensions of the product they are
about to buy. Through this tool, a customer can see the images
of the product and compare it with a series of reference images
known to all, such as a man, a chair, a door or a child. The
experimental evaluation, conducted on Amazon, shows that the
use of the proposed tool helped people to figure out the real
dimensions of products, with respect to the case in which only cut-out images and textual descriptions are provided. In particular,
according to our experiments, people who used the tool were
able to understand the real dimensions of a product with 17.5%
greater accuracy than those who did not use the tool. Focusing
on critical products, average accuracy increased by 24%, with
an improvement of 27% and 11% for products that proved to
be smaller or larger than expected. Therefore, the adoption of
CompareDimensions could help customers to understand the real
dimensions of the products they want to buy, and consequently
reduce the likelihood of a return."
