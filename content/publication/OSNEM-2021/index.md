abstract: "Social media platforms are increasingly used to convey advertising campaigns for 
products or services. A key issue is to identify an appropriate set of influencers
within a social network, investing resources to get them to adopt a product.
Influence maximization is an optimization problem that aims at finding a small
set of users that maximize the spread of influence in a social network.
In this paper we propose an influence maximization algorithm, named Weighted Artificial
Bee Colony (WABC), that is based on a bio-inspired technique for identifying a
subset of users which maximizes the spread. The proposed algorithm has been
applied to a case study that analyzes the propagation of information among
Twitter users during the Constitutional Referendum held in Italy in 2016.
Our analysis is aimed at identifying the main influencers of the *yes* and *no* factions,
and deriving the main information diffusion strategies of each faction during
the political campaign. WABC outperformed ranking-proxy techniques based
on classical centrality measures, i.e., PageRank, Rank and Degree. Even compared
to DIRIE, which exploits a more complex algorithm, WABC was able to
find a more accurate set of users which allows to maximize the spread in almost
all the considered configurations."
