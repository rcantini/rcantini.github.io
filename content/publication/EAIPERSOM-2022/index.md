abstract: "The large amount of information available on the Web can
be effectively exploited in several domains, ranging from opinion mining
to the analysis of human dynamics and behaviors. Specifically, it can be
leveraged to keep up with the latest news around the world, although traditional 
keyword-based techniques make it difficult to understand what
has been happening over an extended period of time. In fact, they do not
provide any organization of the extracted information, which hinders the
general understanding of a topic of interest. This issue can be overcome
by leveraging a Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) system, which allows 
detecting a set of topics of interest, following their evolution through
time. This work proposes a TDT methodology, namely length-weighted
topic chain, assessing its effectiveness over two real-world case studies,
related to the 2016 United States presidential election and the Covid19
pandemic. Experimental results show the quality and meaningfulness of
the identified chains, confirming the ability of our methodology to represent 
well the main topics underlying social media conversation as well
as the relationships among them and their evolution through time."
