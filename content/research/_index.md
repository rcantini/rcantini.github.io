<h2><b>Research topics</b></h2>
My research mainly focuses on the development of innovative algorithms and methodologies for the analysis of Big Data, especially those coming from the main social media, which provide a massive amount of opinion-rich multi-modal data effectively exploitable for extracting valuable information in different application contexts.
Particular attention is paid to:
<ul>
  <li>Advanced machine and deep learning models and architectures, especially in the field of natural language processing.</li>
  <li>Sentiment analysis and opinion mining techniques, aimed at detecting the emotional state and opinion of social users regarding a specific topic/event of interest.</li>
  <li>Hashtag Recommendation and topic modeling.</li>
  <li>Techniques for integrating the classical centralized Cloud Computing architectures with the most recent IoT and Edge/Fog Computing solutions.</li>
  <li>The use of machine learning models for the optimization of large-scale scientific workflows.</li>
</ul>
